## SimBBA Engine V2

### Uploading to confirm readability and use of access for those wishing to improve the engine

### All Required files for getting data from the SimNBA API should be readily available. If there are any changes needed to the data, look in the teamclasses file and the play_by_play collector.

#### This Engine was written by Ezaco, co-written by me (TuscanSota). I do not want to take full credit for this, as the changes I made were to ensure the data received from the API matches with what the objects for the engine are required.
